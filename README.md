# Hi, I’m Bingbing 👋

I’m a Python-focused Data & Automation Engineer with experience building internal tools, workflow automation systems, and financial data pipelines.

My work centers around turning complex, manual processes into reliable, scalable, and maintainable software. I enjoy designing clean architectures, building automation that reduces operational risk, and improving day-to-day productivity through practical engineering.

### ⚙️ Core Strengths
- **Python engineering**: pandas, scripting, PyQt5, modular tooling  
- **Data pipelines**: validation, ingestion, SFTP, APIs, automation workflows  
- **Financial systems**: index methodologies, constituent processing, weighting logic  
- **Automation**: Power Automate, Graph API, Excel/VBA integration  
- **Engineering practices**: Git, testing (pytest), CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

### 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Modern AI tooling (LangChain, RAG, vector search)  
- Workflow intelligence & automation  
- Clean code + testing best practices
